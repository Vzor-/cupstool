# cupstool
A quick program I threw together as both a proof of concept and a debugging tool. It is not up to snuff as far as coding practices go, so don't use it in a larger program without grooming.

If you are here to test printer statuses just run the included jar with 'java -jar cupstool.jar', press 4 then select the printer to test.
